                        There are many different ways you can use our services - to search for your desired candidates; to get our value added services, to share information or queries with us. For all this you need to create an account with us so that we can make those services even better in the future. To show you more relevant search results, present you with more desirable candidates and help you connect with us or make sharing quicker and easier. But before this you need to know how we are using your information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.

                    <h3 className="sub-heading">Information we gather:</h3>

                        We collect basic information like company name, website, company size, number of employees to be hired, compensation and contact details. All of this is just a procedure to verify the organization's availability. Besides, if you want to take the full advantage of indirectly branding your organization then you may have to provide your company logo

                    <h3 className="sub-heading">Accessing your personal information:</h3>

                        Whenever you use our services, we intend to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we provide ways to update it quickly or to delete it - unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. While updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.

                        We aim to maintain our services in a way that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.
